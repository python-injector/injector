Injector Change Log
===================

0.14.0
------

- Add default scope support

0.13.1
------

- Improved some error messages

0.13.0
------

Backwards incompatible:

- Dropped Python 3.2 support
- Dropped Injector use_annotations constructor parameter. Whenever @inject is
  used parameter annotations will be used automatically.
- Dropped Python 2 support (this includes PyPy)
- Removed @provides decorator, use @provider instead
- Removed support for passing keyword arguments to @inject

0.12.0
------

- Fixed binding inference in presence of * and ** arguments (previously Injector
  would generate extra arguments, now it just ignores them)
- Improved error reporting
- Fixed compatibility with newer typing versions (that includes the one
  bundled with Python 3.6)

Technically backwards incompatible:

- Forward references as PEP 484 understands them are being resolved now when
  Python 3-style annotations are used. See
  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#forward-references for details.

  Optional parameters are treated as compulsory for the purpose of injection.

0.11.1
------

- 0.11.0 packages uploaded to PyPI are broken (can't be installed), this is
  a fix-only release.

0.11.0
------

* The following way to declare dependencies is introduced and recommended
  now:

  .. code-block:: python

    class SomeClass:
        @inject
        def __init__(self, other: OtherClass):
            # ...

  The following ways are still supported but are deprecated and will be
  removed in the future:

  .. code-block:: python

    # Python 2-compatible style
    class SomeClass
        @inject(other=OtherClass)
        def __init__(self, other):
            # ...

    # Python 3 style without @inject-decoration but with use_annotations
    class SomeClass:
        def __init__(self, other: OtherClass):
            # ...

    injector = Injector(use_annotations=True)
    # ...

* The following way to declare Module provider methods is introduced and
  recommended now:

  .. code-block:: python

    class MyModule(Module):
        @provider
        def provide_something(self, dependency: Dependency) -> Something:
            # ...

  @provider implies @inject.

  Previously it would look like this:

  .. code-block:: python

    class MyModule(Module):
        @provides(Something)
        @inject
        def provide_something(self, dependency: Dependency):
            # ...

  The :func:`~injector.provides` decorator will be removed in the future.

* Added a :func:`~injector.noninjectable` decorator to mark parameters as not injectable
  (this serves as documentation and a way to avoid some runtime errors)


Backwards incompatible:

* Removed support for decorating classes with :func:`@inject <injector.inject>`. Previously:

  .. code-block:: python

    @inject(something=Something)
    class Class:
        pass

  Now:

  .. code-block:: python

    class Class:
        @inject
        def __init__(self, something: Something):
            self.something = something

* Removed support for injecting partially applied functions, previously:

  .. code-block:: python

    @inject(something=Something)
    def some_function(something):
        pass


    class Class:
        @inject(function=some_function)
        def __init__(self, function):
            # ...

  Now you need to move the function with injectable dependencies to a class.

* Removed support for getting :class:`AssistedBuilder(callable=...) <injector.AssistedBuilder>`
* Dropped Python 2.6 support
* Changed the way :class:`~injector.AssistedBuilder` and :class:`~injector.ProviderOf` are used.
  Previously:

  .. code-block:: python

    builder1 = injector.get(AssistedBuilder(Something))
    # or: builder1 = injector.get(AssistedBuilder(interface=Something))
    builder2 = injector.get(AssistedBuilder(cls=SomethingElse))
    provider = injector.get(ProviderOf(SomeOtherThing))

  Now:

  .. code-block:: python

    builder1 = injector.get(AssistedBuilder[Something])
    builder2 = injector.get(ClassAssistedBuilder[cls=SomethingElse])
    provider = injector.get(ProviderOf[SomeOtherThing])

* Removed support for injecting into non-constructor methods

0.10.1
------

- Fixed a false positive bug in dependency cycle detection (AssistedBuilder can be
  used to break dependency cycles now)

0.10.0
------

- :meth:`injector.Provider.get()` now requires an :class:`injector.Injector` instance as
  its parameter
- deprecated injecting arguments into modules (be it functions/callables,
  :class:`~injector.Module` constructors or :meth:`injector.Module.configure` methods)
- removed `extends` decorator
- few classes got useful __repr__ implementations
- fixed injecting ProviderOf and AssistedBuilders when :class:`injector.Injector`
  auto_bind is set to False (previously would result in `UnsatisfiedRequirement`
  error)
- fixed crash occurring when Python 3-function annotation use is enabled and
  __init__ method has a return value annotation ("injector.UnknownProvider:
  couldn't determine provider for None to None"), should also apply to free
  functions as well

0.9.1
-----
- Bug fix release.

0.9.0
-----

- Child :class:`~injector.Injector` can rebind dependancies bound in parent Injector (that changes :class:`~injector.Provider` semantics), thanks to Ilya Orlov
- :class:`~injector.CallableProvider` callables can be injected into, thanks to Ilya Strukov
- One can request :class:`~injector.ProviderOf` (Interface) and get a :class:`~injector.BoundProvider` which can be used to get an implementation of Interface when needed

0.8.0
-----

- Binding annotations are removed. Use :func:`~injector.Key` to create unique types instead.


0.7.9
-----

- Fixed regression with injecting unbound key resulting in None instead of raising an exception


0.7.8
-----

- Exception is raised when :class:`~injector.Injector` can't install itself into a class instance due to __slots__ presence
- Some of exception messages are now more detailed to make debugging easier when injection fails
- You can inject functions now - :class:`~injector.Injector` provides a wrapper that takes care of injecting dependencies into the original function

0.7.7
-----

- Made :class:`~injector.AssistedBuilder` behave more explicitly: it can build either innstance of a concrete class (``AssistedBuilder(cls=Class)``) or it will follow Injector bindings (if exist) and construct instance of a class pointed by an interface (``AssistedBuilder(interface=Interface)``). ``AssistedBuilder(X)`` behaviour remains the same, it's equivalent to ``AssistedBuilder(interface=X)``

0.7.6
-----

- Auto-convert README.md to RST for PyPi.

0.7.5
-----

- Added a ChangeLog!
- Added support for using Python3 annotations as binding types.
